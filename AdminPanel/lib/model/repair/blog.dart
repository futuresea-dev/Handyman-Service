Our passion is to help you keep your home well maintained – whether you hire us for the job or just learn from us. One area of home maintenance that no homeowner wants to neglect is gutter cleaning.</p><p style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"> It can be easy to ignore clogged gutters…out of sight out of mind right? However, when gutters get clogged with dirt, roofing particles, sticks and leaves, it can cause major problems for your home. Make sure to prioritize gutter cleaning in your home this year.</p><p style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"> First, let’s get specific about the damage that clogged gutters can cause:</p><h2 class=\"western\" style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal;\"> Types of Damage from Clogged Gutters</h2><p><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\">In a&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://blog.expertsinyourhome.com/leaves-in-your-gutter-the-gift-you-dont-want-this-season\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><font color=\"#f05423\">previous blog</font></span></a><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\">&nbsp;written by Experts In Your Home, we detailed the problems clogged gutters can have, including:</span></p><ul> <li><p style=\"margin-top: 0.16cm; margin-bottom: 0.16cm; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: 150%;\"> <font style=\"font-size: 13pt\"><b>Clogged gutters can cause your basement to leak.</b>&nbsp;In fact, they are one of the primary causes of basement and crawl space “water problems,” including (in order of severity) leaks, dampness, mold, mildew and humidity. All of these conditions can occur when clogged gutters overflow and the water accumulates around the foundation.</font></p> </li><li><p style=\"margin-top: 0.16cm; margin-bottom: 0.16cm; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: 150%;\"> <font style=\"font-size: 13pt\"><b>Clogged gutters can cause your foundation to crack.</b>&nbsp;Now a chain reaction has begun,  and it's easy to see why: loose dirt under a foundation settles over time. But when one area settles more quickly than others, exacerbated by water, the additional stress can trigger cracks in the foundation. And if you think interior water damage is expensive to repair, you don't want to see the bill for repairing a faulty foundation.</font></p> </li><li><p style=\"margin-top: 0.16cm; margin-bottom: 0.16cm; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: 150%;\"> <font style=\"font-size: 13pt\"><b>Clogged gutters can compromise your driveway, patio and walkways.</b>&nbsp;The same dynamic can erode the dirt under asphalt, concrete and paver stones,  triggering not only cracks but settling, sags and surface collapse.</font></p> </li><li><p style=\"margin-top: 0.16cm; margin-bottom: 0.16cm; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: 150%;\"> <font style=\"font-size: 13pt\"><b>Clogged gutters attract termites, mosquitoes and other outdoor pests.</b>&nbsp;Termites are drawn to standing water in gutters because they need water to survive. Mosquitoes lay eggs in stagnant water and so are drawn to open pools of water. And birds, mice and squirrels are lured to the sustenance of water, and the determined ones may find may find a way to take up permanent residence in your home by clawing their way into your attic.</font></p> </li><li><p style=\"margin-top: 0.16cm; margin-bottom: 0.16cm; line-height: 150%;\"> <span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><font style=\"font-size: 13pt\"><b>Clogged gutters can damage your home's exterior and especially the roof shingles, soffit, fascia and wood frame or trim.</b></font></span><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><font style=\"font-size: 13pt\">&nbsp;Over time, dry rot can develop.

In general most experts say to clean your gutters in the spring and fall. According to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/c/ah/how-to-clean-gutters/9ba683603be9fa5395fab90ce752a5b#:~:text=Gutters%20need%20to%20be%20cleaned,clogging%20the%20gutters%20and%20downspouts.\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><font color=\"#f05423\">The Home Depot</font></span></a><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\">,</span></p><blockquote style=\"margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0.42cm; line-height: 150%;\"> “Cleaning gutters in early spring will prepare them for the heavy spring and summer rains. In the early fall, clear out leaves and other debris that accumulated during the warmer months.”</blockquote><p style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"> In the Chico area, it may make more sense to clean your gutters later in the fall since our leaves hang on a bit longer. Either way,&nbsp;it’s a good idea to take a look at your gutters and make sure they are cleaned each spring and again in the fall to prepare for winter rains.</p><p style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"> &nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"western\" style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal;\"> How Often do You really Need to Clean Your Gutters?</h2><p><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\">Is cleaning your gutters twice a year really enough? That will depend on where you live and what type of trees you have. For example, experts at&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.angieslist.com/articles/seriously-how-often-should-you-clean-gutters.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><font color=\"#f05423\">Angie’sList</font></span></a><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\">&nbsp;say</span></p><blockquote style=\"margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0.42cm; line-height: 150%;\"> “Twice a year if you have oak trees. If you have pine trees, they may need to be cleaned quarterly, because pines shed a lot.”</blockquote><p style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"> A visual inspection 4 times a year will give you a good idea of what you’re dealing with in terms of gutter clogs and debris. The important thing is that you don’t ignore clogged gutters!</p><p style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"> &nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"western\" style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal;\"> Need Help with Your Gutter Cleaning?</h2><p><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\">At Experts In Your Home we are always happy to help you with your home maintenance projects, and that includes&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.expertsinyourhome.com/request-a-quote-for-services\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><font color=\"#f05423\">gutter cleaning in Chico</font></span></a><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\">&nbsp;and surrounding areas!

For a smaller home with less air pollutants, think fewer people and no pets, you may be able to change the filters every 2-3 months, but still check them every month. The seasons can also affect maintenance. For example, for months like winter where a family is typically indoors more, the quality of air will be more important.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 16px 0px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, arial, sans-serif;\">The types of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/10-important-home-maintenance-tasks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(240, 84, 35); transition: all 0.4s ease-in-out 0s; text-decoration: none;\">filters</a>&nbsp;also vary.

The best times to clean them are late fall, after all the leaves have fallen, and as part of your spring cleaning. However, at least 4 times a year, the gutters should at least be visually inspected. You can do this by walking around the house to see if there is any sagging and if there are any leaks or holes. For good measure, take a ladder and check your roof and gutters to make sure they are also free of debris or damage after each season.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 16px 0px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, arial, sans-serif;\">If you have more trees around your home, it would be good to check on the gutters more often to ensure they aren’t getting filled with debris.

But, how exactly does this work? A smart thermostat is connected through Wi-Fi, allowing you to control the temperature of your home remotely from a smartphone app. Program the temperature settings based on daily schedules, weather conditions, or heating and cooling needs.</p><h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 10px 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Lato, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(57, 57, 57); font-size: 30px; line-height: 1.1; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;\">Wireless LED Bulbs</h2><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 16px 0px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, arial, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https://blog.expertsinyourhome.com/popular-interior-lighting-trends-of-2020\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(240, 84, 35); transition: all 0.4s ease-in-out 0s; text-decoration: none;\">Lighting at home</a>&nbsp;is about more than screwing in a light bulb.

Smart faucets are also more hygienic since there is no need to touch the faucet when in use. Control the faucet with your voice or motion sensors. This makes it perfect for families with small children, the elderly, or those living with a disability.</p><h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 10px 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Lato, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(57, 57, 57); font-size: 30px; line-height: 1.1; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;\">Self-Sanitizing Door Handles</h2><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 16px 0px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, arial, sans-serif;\">One of the most touched surfaces in your home is the door handle you use to enter and exit every day. You are not the only one touching it. Everyone who reaches to open the door has the potential of spreading germs. The self-sanitizing door handle technology uses UV light to kill germs. This is especially important if you or a loved one you live with is elderly or has a compromised immune system, but it is also great to use with children.</p><h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 10px 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Lato, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(57, 57, 57); font-size: 30px; line-height: 1.1; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;\">Setting Up Technology In Your Home</h2><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 16px 0px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, arial, sans-serif;\">These are just a few of the latest trendy home technology that is currently available.
